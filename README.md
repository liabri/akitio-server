The language spoken in this commune is a descendent of the Celtic family, most closely related to the variant of Cornish spoken in Earth's XVII century.

### Tahilelei 
A small village on Kīro's south-eastern coast, hidden from conquerors due to its geographic location. An ancient people call this village home, ones from before the great conquest of Kīro, no one knows their true origins. The language spoken is part of the Tongic subgroup of the Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family on Earth. The name is a composition of « tahi (water) » and « lelei (clear) »

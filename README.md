# Akitio
A modded minecraft world originally created in 1.16.5 featuring Myself, Charlotte & Navet. 

## Kīro
The first region of the world generated in 1.16.5, most notably known for its pre-1.18 generation including the TerraformersMC generation mods.

### 鐵里 (Teichi)
The oldest civilisation surviving into the modern era, originally a small town situated on Mount Ferrous towards the south of Kīro, building their remparts in antiquity — which is what historians believe led to their continued exist ; unlike the numerous surrounding settlements pillaged by the Barbarian Herds from the North East. The city continued to grow wide and far, becoming the central point of RELIGION_NAME in all of Kīro with their pagoda PAGODA_NAME being the biggest and grandest of all in Akitio. The city is divided into four main districts with countless towns right up against it, they are all governed by the Teichi Central Assembly (TCA) which formally acts from the BUILDING_NAME, located by the river RIVER_NAME in the modern district. The language spoken in this commune is a descendent of Earth's Okinawan language, making it part of the Japonic language family.

### Dew'venork
A commune situated towards the south-west of the continent Kīro, known for its magnificent cathedral and old walled city. The name is a contraction of « Dewavenorker », literally translating to « Two River City ». The city is comprised of two independent villages functioning under a single government, XXX, the walled city ; and XXX the town outside the southern walls. There are numerous small villages in the surrounding areas which respond to Dew'venork but still hold great autonomy. The language spoken in this commune is a descendent Earth's Cornish language, making it a part of the Celtic family.

### Tahilelei 
A small village on Kīro's south-western coast. Being well hidden from conquerors due to its geographic location, it is inhabited by an ancient people of whom no one knows their origin, likely from well before the great conquest of Kīro. The language spoken is part of the Tongic subgroup of the Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family on Earth. The name is a composition of « tahi (water) » and « lelei (clear) »

## Reykinvalr
Region which led the world into the industrial revolution with the addition of the « Create » mod ; particularly the city of XXX. Cities in Kīro such as 鐵里 and Dew'venork quickly caught up.
